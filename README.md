## College-Connection

It today's world, being connected is at the forefront of just about everything. Another huge industry that is in the headlines for many reasons is education. Young adults that graduate from High School are left with a very important decision. To continue on the path of higher education and earn a degree or go else where. Well, College Connection is the app that will help all students decide what college is right for them. College Connection is a list of schools where you can view the institutions social media accounts all in one area. There is no need to have to search all around in order to find this info anymore. This will allow the student to gauge the people, activities and just the basic life on a particular campus. With your help, I hope to add many more schools to the list. And as always remember, connect before you select!
